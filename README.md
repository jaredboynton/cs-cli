## Usage

After running `./setup`, use the `./cli` command to extract calls:

### Basic Usage

**Extract calls by customer (most common):**
```bash
# Last 7 days for customer
./cli --customer "7-11" 

# Last 30 days for customer
./cli --customer "Postman" --days 30

# Customer with partial name matching
./cli --customer "7-" 
```

**Extract calls from folder (team calls):**
```bash
# Use default folder - last 7 days
./cli

# Specific folder - last 30 days  
./cli --folder-id "195005774106634129" --days 30
```

### Date Range Options
```bash
# Customer-based with date ranges
./cli --customer "7-11" --from-date 2024-01-01 --to-date 2024-01-31

# Folder-based with date ranges
./cli --folder-id "195005774106634129" --from-date 2024-01-01 --to-date 2024-01-31

# From specific date to now
./cli --customer "Postman" --from-date 2024-01-01

# All calls up to specific date  
./cli --customer "7-11" --to-date 2024-01-31
```

### Other Options
```bash
# Enable debug logging
./cli --debug --customer "7-11"

# Custom output directory  
./cli --output-dir ./my-calls --customer "Postman"

# Get help
./cli --help
```

### Customer Search Features

The `--customer` parameter uses intelligent autocomplete matching:

- **Partial matching**: `--customer "7-"` finds "7 - Eleven (7 - 11) Inc.", "700Apps", "777 Partners", etc.
- **Fuzzy matching**: `--customer "seven"` finds "7 - Eleven (7 - 11) Inc."
- **Company resolution**: Automatically resolves customer names to company entities in Gong
- **Multiple matches**: If multiple companies match, includes calls from all matching entities

## Workflows & Use Cases

This tool enables two powerful workflows for converting conversation data into actionable business insights. Both work best when combined with AI agents for post-processing analysis.

### Workflow 1: Team Performance & Coaching Analysis

**Objective:** Generate weekly performance summaries and identify coaching opportunities across your team.

**Setup Process:**
1. **Create a Team Stream in Gong:** Set up a dedicated folder/stream containing your team members' calls
2. **Weekly Extraction:** Run every Friday to capture the full week's activities

**Extraction Command:**
```bash
# Extract last week's team calls
./cli --folder-id "your-team-stream-id" --days 7

# Or use specific date range for consistency
./cli --folder-id "your-team-stream-id" --from-date 2024-01-15 --to-date 2024-01-19
```

**AI Post-Processing Framework:**
Use Claude, Cursor, or another AI agent to analyze the extracted transcripts for:

- **Performance Metrics:** Talk/listen ratios, question frequency, meeting control
- **Deal Progression:** Advancement signals, next steps clarity, timeline adherence  
- **Coaching Opportunities:** Objection handling, discovery depth, presentation skills
- **Customer Wins:** Value realization moments, competitive advantages, success stories
- **Process Adherence:** Methodology following, documentation quality

**Recommended AI Analysis Prompt Structure:**
```
Analyze these [X] call transcripts from our sales team this week.

For each call, extract:
1. Key outcomes and progression signals
2. Coaching opportunities (specific behaviors to improve)
3. Customer sentiment and engagement level
4. Competitive mentions or concerns
5. Process adherence (discovery, demo, next steps)

Then create a summary report with:
- Executive summary of week's impact
- Individual performance highlights/areas for improvement  
- Top 5 coaching priorities across the team
- Customer wins and success stories to share
- Action items for next week

Include specific quotes as evidence for all observations.
```

**Success Metrics:**

### Workflow 2: Customer Evolution & Relationship Analysis

**Objective:** Build comprehensive customer health assessments and identify renewal risks or expansion opportunities.

**Setup Process:**
1. **Pre-QBR Analysis:** Extract 30-90 days before quarterly business reviews
2. **Renewal Preparation:** Run 60-90 days before renewal dates
3. **Escalation Investigation:** Extract when customer issues arise

**Extraction Command:**
```bash
# Extract 60 days of customer interactions
./cli --customer "Postman" --days 60

# Or analyze specific time periods
./cli --customer "7-11" --from-date 2024-01-01 --to-date 2024-03-31
```

**Supported Browsers:**
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox  
- Safari (macOS)
- Brave Browser
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera
- Chromium

The tool will try each browser and use the first one with valid Gong cookies.

## Output

The tool creates organized directories with:
- **Customer extractions**: `ct_[customer-name]/` (e.g., `ct_7-11/`, `ct_postman/`)
- **Team call extractions**: `team-calls-[date]/` (e.g., `team-calls-2024-01-15/`)
- Individual markdown files for each call
- `SUMMARY.md` with an overview of all extracted calls

Customer folders are prefixed with `ct_` for easy organization and git exclusion.

### Markdown Format
Each call transcript includes:
- Call title and customer information
- Date and attendee list
- Full transcript with speaker identification
- Call metadata (ID, URL if available)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GONG_DEBUG=true` - Enable debug logging
